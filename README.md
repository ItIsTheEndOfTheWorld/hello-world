In the beginning the Universe was created. 

This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move.

"Many races believe that it was created by some sort of god, though the Jatravartid people of Viltvodle VI believe that the entire Universe was sneezed out of the nose of a being called the Great Green Arkleseizure. The Jatravartids, who live in perpetual fear of the time they call The Coming of the Great White Handkerchief, are small blue creatures with more than fifty arms each, who are therefore unique in being the only race in history to have invented aerosol deodorant before the wheel." (The Restaurant at the End of the Universe)
